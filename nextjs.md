# Getting Started
Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the [learn course](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Next.js

## System Requirements
- Node.js 12.22.0 or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

# Automatic Setup
We recommend creating a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest # folder name
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
```

If you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the `--typescript` flag:

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
# or
yarn create next-app --typescript
# or
pnpm create next-app --typescript
```

After the installation is complete:
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view you application
- Edit `pages/index.js` and see the updated result in your browser

For more information on how to use `create-next-app` , you can review the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).
