Whether or not you should learn TypeScript depends on your goals and needs. Here are a few things to consider:

- If you're working on a large or complex JavaScript project, TypeScript can help you catch bugs early and improve the maintainability of your code. It can also make it easier for new team members to understand your codebase.

- If you're interested in using modern JavaScript features, such as classes and decorators, but need to support older browsers or runtimes, TypeScript can help you use these features while still maintaining compatibility.

- If you're planning on using a framework or library that is written in TypeScript, such as Angular or NestJS, learning TypeScript can make it easier to work with that framework or library.

- If you're new to programming and just want to learn the basics of JavaScript, it might be best to start with plain JavaScript first and then consider learning TypeScript later.

Ultimately, whether or not you should learn TypeScript depends on your goals and the needs of your projects. If you think it could be useful for your work, it might be worth taking some time to learn the basics.
